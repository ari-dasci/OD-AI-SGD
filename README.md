The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations Agenda 2030 constitute a global blueprint agenda and instrument for peace and prosperity worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies are becoming omnipresent in our lifes, hence their influence may be decissive in the pursuance of the SDGs. Accordingly, we carried out a comprehensive review of existing literature in which AI and other digital technologies are used to address the SDGs. This review results in:

1. A snapshot and a comprehensive view of the progress made and prospects in the relationship between AI and the SDG.
2. A SWOT analysis of AI driven technologies as facilitators or barriers  to each of the SDGs.
3. Identifying of the efforts made in applying AI technologies in SDGs, and pinpoint opportunities for further progress along the current decade.
4. Distilling ongoing challenges and target areas for important advances.
5. A compilation of ***869*** publications related to the application of AI and other digital technologies to boost the attainment of the SDGs.

The results from 1 to 4 are exponded in the paper entitled:
